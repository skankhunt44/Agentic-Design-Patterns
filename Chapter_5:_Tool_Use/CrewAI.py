# For production, it's recommended to use a more secure method for key management
# like environment variables loaded at runtime or a secret manager.
#
# Set the environment variable for your chosen LLM provider (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY)
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
# os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = "gpt-4o"
